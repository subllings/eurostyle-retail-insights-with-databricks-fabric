# Pedagogical Approach  

This project follows a **modern learning methodology** combining multiple proven educational techniques for maximum effectiveness in technical skill development.

## Core Learning Principles  

### 1. Just-in-Time Learning (JIT Learning)  
- **Learn when you need it**: Theory is provided right before you apply it  
- **Avoid cognitive overload**: No information dump, focused learning  
- **Maximize retention**: Immediate application reinforces understanding  

### 2. Microlearning  
- **Small learning units**: Each lesson is 15–20 minutes maximum  
- **Precise learning objectives**: Clear, measurable goals for each task  
- **Concrete deliverable**: Every task produces a tangible result  

### 3. Learning by Doing / Constructivism  
- **Immediate practice**: Apply theory right after learning it  
- **Build knowledge through experience**: Hands-on construction of understanding  
- **Highly effective for technical skills**: Perfect for data engineering, analytics, and ML  

### 4. Scaffolding (Educational Scaffolding)  
- **Structured support that gradually decreases**: Strong guidance at first → progressive autonomy  
- **Each task prepares the next**: Building complexity step by step  
- **Safe learning environment**: Mistakes are learning opportunities  

### 5. Problem-Based Learning (PBL)  
- **Real-world problem solving**: Focus on concrete business challenges  
- **Professional context**: The MA case mirrors actual industry scenarios  
- **Intrinsic motivation**: Relevance drives engagement  

### 6. Agile Learning  
- **Short sprints with rapid feedback**: Quick iterations and continuous improvement  
- **Team collaboration**: Cross-functional learning and knowledge sharing  
- **Adaptive approach**: Adjust based on progress and blockers

## How to Work with This Project  

### ❌ Don't do this:  
- Read all documentation first, then start coding  
- Try to understand everything before beginning  
- Work in isolation without team interaction  

### ✅ Do this instead:  
1. **Read the Business Case** (overview understanding)  
2. **Start Sprint 0** (setup and team formation)  
3. **Work task by task** following this structure:  
   - **Read the theory** (just enough for the task)  
   - **Apply immediately** (hands-on practice)  
   - **Deliver the result** (concrete output)  
   - **Share with team** (collaboration and feedback)

## Task-Based Learning Structure  

Each sprint is broken down into **micro-tasks** with this pattern:  

### Task Template  

**Task X.Y: [Task Name]**  
**Estimated Time**: 30–45 minutes  
**Learning Objective**: [Specific skill/knowledge]  

**Theory (15 min):**  
- Key concept explanation  
- Relevant documentation links  
- Best practices  

**Practice (25 min):**  
- Step-by-step instructions  
- Code examples  
- Troubleshooting tips  

**Deliverable:**  
- [Specific output expected]  
- [Quality criteria]  

**Team Collaboration:**  
- [How to share/review with team]

## Sprint Progression  

The project follows a **4-sprint progression** designed around the **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold), ensuring each team member develops both technical skills and business acumen.  

### Sprint 0: Foundation (0.5 day)  
*Just-in-Time Learning*: Environment setup and orientation  
- Configure Microsoft Fabric workspace and Databricks environment  
- Establish OneLake connection and private networking  
- Team formation and role clarification  
- Understand technical and governance constraints  

### Sprint 1: Bronze Layer – Ingestion (4.5 days)  
*Learning by Doing*: Ingest raw data into OneLake + Databricks  
- First contact with MA case dataset (sales, operations, external sources)  
- Use pipelines to land raw data in Delta tables (Bronze)  
- Initial quality checks and metadata documentation  
- Validate ingestion with Power BI connectivity test  

### Sprint 2: Silver Layer – Transformation & Business Rules (4.5 days)  
*Problem-Based Learning*: Cleaning and structuring data  
- Apply data quality rules and business transformations  
- Implement business logic (KPIs, hierarchies, domain rules)  
- Collaborative problem-solving on data integration issues  
- Create reusable Delta tables in Silver layer accessible to both Fabric and Databricks  

### Sprint 3: Gold Layer – Analytics & Modeling (4.5 days)  
*Scaffolding*: Build business-ready datasets and models  
- Aggregate data for marts (sales, finance, operations)  
- Create semantic models in Fabric connected to Gold Delta tables  
- Develop dashboards in Power BI (KPI tracking, executive view)  
- Introduce ML scenario in Databricks (basic model with MLflow tracking)  

### Sprint 4: Integration & Deployment (4.5 days)  
*Constructivism*: End-to-end deployment and presentation  
- Validate pipeline orchestration and cross-platform flows  
- Optimize performance (caching, partitioning, shortcuts)  
- Deploy dashboards to workspace with access controls  
- Present final integrated solution (OneLake + Databricks + Fabric + Power BI)

## Success Factors  

### For Learners  
- **Embrace the "not knowing"**: It's normal not to understand everything at first  
- **Focus on the current task**: Don't get overwhelmed by the big picture  
- **Ask questions immediately**: Don't wait until you're stuck  
- **Share your progress**: Regular team check-ins accelerate learning  

### For Coaches  
- **Provide just enough theory**: Resist the urge to explain everything upfront  
- **Celebrate small wins**: Every completed task is progress  
- **Encourage experimentation**: Safe-to-fail environment promotes learning  
- **Facilitate collaboration**: Cross-team learning multiplies knowledge

## Quality Assurance  

Each task includes:  
- **Clear acceptance criteria**: You know when you're done  
- **Self-assessment questions**: Validate your understanding  
- **Peer review opportunities**: Learn from each other  
- **Coach checkpoints**: Expert feedback at key milestones
